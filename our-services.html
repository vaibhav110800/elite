                culture, the position, responsibilities and necessary qualifications needed to do justice to the
                position. Once the profile is developed, we define our search strategy, including target sectors,
                companies as well as levels which result in finding the best person for the job.</p> <br>

            <p>We conduct preliminary research for developing an initial candidate list. We contact, assess and validate
                a short list of potential candidates through telephonic and personal interviews. We then prepare a
                candidate assessment report, which is then presented to the client for review. When the client is ready
                to proceed on the list, our team assists with coordinating the interviews as well as taking &
                incorporating regular feedback.</p><br>

            <h2>Search Completion, follow up and hand holding</h2>
            <p>We consult with our clients to review top candidates and support the selection process. If needed we
                provide support in the negotiations between the client and candidate. Even after the position is filled,
                we conduct ongoing follow-up with both client and candidate to ensure success of the hired executive.
